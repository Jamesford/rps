# Rock Papper Scissors for Slack

Challenge your Slack team members to a game of Rock Paper Scissors

### TODO
  - Clean up `challengeHandler` and `interactionHandler`, they're a mess
  - Clean up `utils.go`, it's also a bit sloppy
  - Add bot user to app to send messages `as_user`
  - Add rematch button after game ends
  - Tests! Write tests! Many tests!
